Listen up, y'all 'cause this is it
The function that I'm graphin' is de-li-cious

Take the limit definition; d/dx a function
They want my zeros so they get their pleasures from conjunctions
You can read me, can calculate me
I ain't easy, make you queasy
I got reasons why I freeze, hon
Values come and go, like seasons

Take the limit (so many digits)
But, I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
Square root neg one's ficticious
I take values (___!)
That puts them y's on rock, rock
And they be lining down the iroc
Just to watch what I've got

It goes to zero (It's naught, naught)
It goes to zero (I put them y's on rock, rock)
It goes to zero (They want a taste of what I've got)
I'm a limit (t-t-t-t-t tasty tasty)

Take the limit def-
Take the limit def-
Take the limit def- (def, def-, def- def-...)

Take the limit definition make derivatives go crazy
They always claim they know me
Coming to me, call me easy
I'm the the L to the I-M-I the T, easy
Ain't no other method put it down like me

Take the limit (so many digits)
My curves stay vicious
I be up, in the algebra working on my digits
He's my witness (ooh wee)
That puts them y's on rock, rock
And they be lining down the iroc
Just to watch what I've got

It goes to zero (It's naught, naught)
It goes to zero (I put them y's on rock, rock)
It goes to zero (They want a taste of what I've got)
I'm a limit (t-t-t-t-t tasty tasty)

H-h-h-h-hold up! Check it out!

Baby, baby, baby
If you really want me
Honey get some patience
Maybe then you'll get a taste
Of my
